= !InlineMacro =

== Description ==

The !InlineMacro package returns raw, inline XHTML markup that has been validated
and sanitized.

== Validation ==

Markup that doesn't follow these requirements will be rejected with an error message:

 * Elements must be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_element well-formed].
 * Tags and attribute identifiers must be in lowercase, attribute values are required and must be enclosed in quotes.
 * Empty elements must be self-closing with a space before the forward slash, e.g. <img ... />.

== Sanitization ==

Dangerous constructs such as <script> elements will be removed.

== Use Cases ==

`Inline` is useful for creating "phrase" elements not supported by WikiFormatting, or
for including attributes such as titles. The `#!html` [WikiProcessors WikiProcessor]
works well for creating larger chunks of markup, and in particular block-level elements
such as an <address> that are also not supported (a [http://microformats.org/ Microformat]
is an excellent example). However, `Inline` is designed to be embedded directly in another
construct, typically a paragraph of text.

== Installation ==

Download the attached [zipfile], unpack to a temporary location, visit the `0.11` directory
and run:

{{{
python setup.py bdist_egg
cp dist/*.egg /trac/env/Project/plugins
}}}

== Configuration ==
